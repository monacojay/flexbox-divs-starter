        <p>If ever there were a time to look to the stars, that time is now. And as you go and grow and throw your spirit and hopes out into the abyss of your future, just remember this moment when you learned how to <span style="color: #f77777">walk on the moon</span>. There are certain uncertainties in life for which you must certainly prepare. All you need is a little foresight and <span style="color: #f77777">these three pointers</span> I've given you below, that are all actually the same pointer really. The foresight though, you must provide that youself. Unfortunately most work in developing foresight is done in hindsight. Irregardlessly, just think about what you've learned here today.</p>

                1<br>Walking on the moon is a lot like jumping on a trampoline in slow motion. The weightlessness is a cool
                feeling but the important thing is land smoothly on your feet. So many people get screwed up because of the
                drawn out time it takes to land.

                2<br>The most important aspect of learning how to walk on the moon is being patient enough for that next step.
                When you jump on the moon you go a little bit further into the air, but you fall slower and need to wait a
                little bit before you use your legs for the landing.

                3<br>Many people get tripped up when jumping on the moon because they gauge their landing way to early and end up
                falling on their face. Itâ€™s true that everybody can be Michael Jordan on the moon, just be careful about
                that landing.
